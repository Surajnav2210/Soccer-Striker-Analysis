# Soccer-Striker-Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between age and striker performance in soccer using the "Combined FIFA DataSet (1930-2014)" from Kaggle. Key performance metrics, including striker ratings, overall scores, and physical/technical attributes, were compared across two age groups: 26 and under, and over 26. The findings indicate that older strikers often exhibit greater consistency and higher performance levels due to their experience and tactical knowledge, despite declines in physical attributes. Insights from this study can aid coaches in building balanced teams that combine youthful energy with seasoned expertise.
